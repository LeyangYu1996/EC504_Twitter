There are 4 codes in the /MainProg/final folder. Each code represents a tested data structure. The fastest one is 'byUOmap.cpp' in the 'vector' folder.<br/>
To run these codes, just clone the repository, go into the folder and make(makefile already included). Be sure to justify the database file when running. For example, to fun the 'byUOmap.cpp' using 'abcnews-date-text.csv', the commands should be:
```
make
./byUOmap abcnews-date-text.csv
```
GUI codes are in the 'Qt_GUI' folder and can only operate when Qt is installed in the desktop.<br/>
The final result screenshot is shown below. Two timinng figures are also included in the repository named 'Reading.pdf' and 'Searching.pdf'.<br/>
